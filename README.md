# test_application

This Flutter project provides an example of a simple comparison between two images.

## Getting Started

We are using the image_picker library to select images and comparing their file name, format, height x width, and array of bytes. To enhance user experience, the app will display the result of the comparison on the screen after the user selects two images.

We are currently working on unit tests for the app, but are having trouble testing the image_picker library.

We hope that you find this project helpful. Thank you!
